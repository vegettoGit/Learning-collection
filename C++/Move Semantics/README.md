## [Back to Basics: C++ Move Semantics - Andreas Fertig - CppCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knEaMpytRMA&list=LL6MKUgGZ9Q8c2Ff7GnoRoqA)
### Topics covered:
* Move semantics: Move or duplicate.
* Overloads.
* Triggering the rvalue-overload. `std::move` is a cast.
* The value categories.
* The place of a potential performance win.
* A "moved from" object is nothing special.
* The Standard Template Library (STL), move and custom object.
* `std::move` is not always the right thing.
* `move` or `forward`.
* Perfect forwarding.
* Use `move` only rarely.
* Compiler-generated special members.
* Utilizing move semantics even more: ref-qualifiers.
