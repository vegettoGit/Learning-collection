## [C++ And Beyond: Discussion - Vittorio Romeo, Kevlin Henney, Nico Josuttis & Kate Gregory - ACCU 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AmjHjYUx6c)
### Panelists:
* Vittorio Romeo, Kevlin Henney, Nicolai Josuttis, Kate Gregory.
### Moderator: 
* Bryce Adelstein Lelbach.
### Topics covered:
* The greatest challenge C++ is facing today.
  * Evolving while keeping backwards compatibility, ABI, C++ will continue getting more complex, making the language more welcoming and inclusive, etc.
* Alternative languages:
  * Carbon, Rust, Cpp2, Jai (game dev), etc.
* Why is there so much resistance to making breaking changes in C++?
* Would C++ be better if it had a single implementation, instead of multiple vendors?
* C++ package management and build systems. Does it need to be standarized?
* Large Language Models (LLMs) and our Software Tools.
* What should C++ programmers do to prepare for the future?
* What are you most looking forward to in C++23, 26 and beyond?

## [ISO C++ Standards Committee Panel Discussion - Hosted by Herb Sutter - CppCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI21tpdkHA8)
### Panelists:
* Bjarne Stroustrup, Daisy Hollman, Daniela Engert, David Sankel, Inbal Levi, Michael Wong, Nina Ranns, Pablo Halpern, Timur Doumler.
### Moderator: 
* Herb Sutter.
### Topics covered:
* Bjarne: Balancing stability, flexibility and evolution is hard.
* What can we learn from other languages? 
  * Carbon, Rust and so on.
  * Better error messages.
  * Tooling infrastructure.
* What would you remove (deprecate) from the standard?
  * Difficult, as there are many people depending on things.
  * ABIs depend on the platform vendors.
  * Even though we cannot simplify the language, we can simplify the use of the language.
  * Deprecated default capture of this, a big win for a lot of the uses of lambdas.
  * Deprecated comma operator inside square brackets.
* How to improve accessibility in the collaboration model?
* How do we tackle the increasing complexity of the language?
* Is there a plan to complete the C++ Core Guidelines?
* How can we improve C++ education?
* How can we know what's on the table for C++'s Language Evolution?
* Can we have a Math Plotting library in C++?
