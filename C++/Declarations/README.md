## [Back to Basics: Declarations in C++ - Ben Saks - CppCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK4GhjmSC6w&list=LL6MKUgGZ9Q8c2Ff7GnoRoqA)
### Topics covered:
* Entities and Properties.
 * Entities: function, namespace, object, template, type, value.
 * C++ programs can declare names to designate entities.
 * A declared name can have properties such as: type, scope, storage, duration, linkage.
 * Not every name has all properties.
* Declarations and Definitions.
 * Declaration: "Here is a name and some properties for an entity". "It might be here, or it might be somewhere else".
 * Definition: "Here is a name and the complete set of properties for an entity that's right here".
 * All definitions are declarations.
* The Structure of Declarations.
 * Every object and function declaration has a sequence of one or more declaration specifiers, and a declarator.
* Declarator Initializers.
* `const` vs `constexpr`.
* Using `typename` with Dependent Names.
 * The Keyword `typename`.
 * Two-Phase Translation.
 * Member Types and `typename`.
 * Type vs. Non-Type Names.
 * Dependent vs. Non-Dependent Names.
* Rvalue References vs Forwarding References.
