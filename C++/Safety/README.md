## [Removing Needless Undefined Behavior for a Safer C++ - Alisdair Meredith - ACCU 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY7ft98nM2k)
### Addressing UB for a Safer C++.
### Topics covered:
* Discussion of what we mean by Undefined Behavior.
  * What is a program?
  * What is UB?
  * What is behavior?
  * What is compile-time behavior?
  * What is Unspecified Behavior?
  * What is Implementation-Defined Behavior?
  * Example 1: Demonstrating time travel.
  * Example 2: Is time travel inevitable?
  * What is Undefined Behavior?
  * What are the bounds of Undefined Behavior?
* Undefined Behavior in the process of translating a program.
  * UB at compile time.
  * UB in the preprocessor.
* Common sources of Undefined Behavior.
  * Indeterminate Values. Uninitialised local variables.
  * Indeterminate Values. Beyond local variables.
* Potential improvements.
  * Many ways forward.
  * Erroneous Behavior.
  * Preconditions in core language.
  * Contracts are coming! On target for C++26. Examples.
