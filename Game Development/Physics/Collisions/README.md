# [Physics for Game Programmers; Continuous Collision - Erin Catto - GDC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nKOET6zwI&list=LL6MKUgGZ9Q8c2Ff7GnoRoqA)
## Walks through a series of collision problems and various solutions for them: Ball bouncing on the ground (solution uses time of impact calculation and substepping); Continuous Collision detection in Diablo 3 with Blizzard's Domino engine (example: hitting ragdoll enemies and preventing them from getting stuck on a wall, it focuses on Dynamic vs Static objects collision as opposed to Dynamic vs Dynamic) as opposed to using Discrete Collision detection; and time of impact between two convex polygons (ray cast, linear cast, brute force, conservative advancement, bilateral advancement).
