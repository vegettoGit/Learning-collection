## Topics include: Review of Constraints, Position constraint for bottom of ramp, Position constraint for circular section, Contact constraint, Contact velocity constraint, Center of Mass Velocity, Constraint impulse, Global solvers vs Local (iterative) solvers, Sequential impulses local solver, Understanding Convergence (Circle stack examples), Warm Starting for Convergence, Understanding Inequality Constraints, In search of overshoot (box on a plane, box on a pole), Improve Sequential Impulsers with block solvers, Understanding Acceleration Constraints (associated with forces), Solving position errors by velocity steering and Position solvers (Cloth, Character).

# [Physics for Game Programmers; Continuous Collision - Erin Catto - GDC 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nKOET6zwI&list=LL6MKUgGZ9Q8c2Ff7GnoRoqA)
## Walks through a series of collision problems and various solutions for them: Ball bouncing on the ground (solution uses time of impact calculation and substepping); Continuous Collision detection in Diablo 3 with Blizzard's Domino engine (example: hitting ragdoll enemies and preventing them from getting stuck on a wall, it focuses on Dynamic vs Static objects collision as opposed to Dynamic vs Dynamic) as opposed to using Discrete Collision detection; and time of impact between two convex polygons (ray cast, linear cast, brute force, conservative advancement, bilateral advancement).
