## Describes Overwatch's Replay System and how it relates to the game's Network Synchronization model. Other topics include: Brief review of Network Synchronization models, how to build a Replay system on each of them, more details on the State Based Network Synchronization model used by Overwatch (Deltas, server adaptiveness to client Bandwidth, Packet Loss, custom UDP protocol, Join in Progress, etc.), the Synchronization API, etc.

## Overwatch focuses on responsiveness and accuracy and therefore a Deterministic simulation is a great fit. This talks describes the game's Deterministic foundation (non-strict in comparison to a Lockstep network model), as well as other topics such as the Entity Component System, Input Synchronization, Synchronized clock or Predicting and Acknowledging Hit Registration.
